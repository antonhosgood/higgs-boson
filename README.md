# Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge

This repository contains the code for the Higgs boson machine learning challenge (https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs).

Based off of [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/higgs-boson/data) Kaggle competition.

No external libraries were used besides `NumPy` (part of the challenge).

# Overview

`helpers.py` - Module containing helper functions for reading and writing data, as well as making predictions.

`implementations.py` - Module containing implementations of loss functions and machine learning methods.

`model_weights.pickle` - Pre-trained model weights.

`processing.py` - Module containing functions to process and transform the data, as well as for feature engineering.

`run.py` - Script loading pre-trained model and creating submission file of predictions.
